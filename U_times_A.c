/* This function computes the product of an upper triangular matrix and a regular dense matrix. It will be used to multiply the
inverse of a diagonal block of U (produced by invert_U.c) by an off-diagonal block of A and thereby solve for an off-diagonal
block of L. The function will be executed on a single processor using OpenMP for parallelization.*/
