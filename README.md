# CS420 Final Project: Parallel LU Decomposition

For the final project of this parallel programming course, I led my group in implementing and testing a parallel algorithm for performing an LU decomposition of a dense matrix. Please see `report.pdf` for details about the algorithm, implementation, and scaling results. `src` contains the implementation, `test` contains the test scripts, and `data` contains the raw output from the tests.
