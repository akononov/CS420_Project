/* This function computes the product of a lower triangular matrix and a regular dense matrix. It will be used to multiply the
inverse of a diagonal block of L (produced by invert_L.c) by an off-diagonal block of A and thereby solve for an off-diagonal
block of U. The function will be executed on a single processor using OpenMP for parallelization.*/
