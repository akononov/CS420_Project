/* This function computes the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix, and then subtracts that product
from a regular dense matrix. It will be used to update blocks of A after we've solved for a pair of L and U blocks whose product
contributes to that block of A. The function will be executed on a single processor using OpenMP for parallelization.*/
